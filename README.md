# OSDI-Implementation

Open Supporter Data Interface (OSDI) is a way for progressive US-based organizations which do community, labor and political organizing, use CiviCRM and are customers of various progressive data vendors to “sync up all their stuff” about contacts and their various activities.

With the implementation of the OSDI API by an organization using CiviCRM, and coming OSDI implementations by these (and other) progressive data and software vendors, supporter data from NGP VAN, ShareProgress, Salsa and the Action Network can be synced to that organization’s CiviCRM installation. Similarly, CiviCRM data will be able to be synchronized to these other applications.

## Overview

The OSDI API implementation is in line with CiviCRM's mission to be an open platform for organizations of all sizes. Creating the implementation will allow them to use the OSDI API easily. The existence of a common API will reduce progressive data vendors’ customer costs related to moving data between different systems, lower integration costs and enhance the ability of innovators to create products for the marketplace.

## Benefits of a common API

### Customers, Digital and Tech Directors, Technology Consultants

Less manual and error-prone data import/export
Staff and volunteer data entry time savings
Better ability to pick and choose technology products and use them together
Multi-vendor solutions mean less scope for problems.

### Technology Application Developers

Write platform integration code once rather than per platform which requires less development hours
Data consistency across platforms reduces cost
Can spend more resources on new customer features rather than integration code.

### Platform Vendors

Ability to integrate means an easier sell to customers who already use another platform
Common API across vendors enables a larger app ecosystem for the platform
